Overall:

== random 
 -- fix simulation diagram
 -- fix sample tables
 -- rerun analysis with new jet templates
 -- k-factors?

== Stuff on cH sample:
    -- jet selection plots DONE FIX !!! BINNING IN DELTAPHI !!!

== reducible backgrounds:
    -- Make plots comparing 2P2F shape and 3P1F shape
    -- ask gerrit about rate unc justification

== sideband validation
    -- fix plots to have uncertainty band

== uncertainties: 
    -- implement PDF and scale uncertainties
    == theory uncertainties
        --- 50% on ggH?
        --- other cross sections
    -- Implement FS uncertainty


== Appendix
    == framework
        -- check number of events used in analysis

== fit
    - do the fit...



acceptance loss:
    -- 50% is inside detector acceptance (when not, its due to loss of at least one muon)
    -- after four muon selection approx 26% remains
    -- 11% remains after one jet requirement
    -- 10% remains after the Higgs reconstruction

    -- approx 70% of events have only one jet
    -- approx 25% have two jets
    -- 5% have more than two


To do for chapter 3: 

    -- reducible backgrounds DONE
    -- sideband validation
    -- unrolled discriminator
    -- fix uncertainty discussion
    -- fix missing citations
    -- Make plots comparing 2P2F shape and 3P1F shape
