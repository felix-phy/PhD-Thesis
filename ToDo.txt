Introduce backgrounds in theory section?

--- cH ---
Fix genparton diagram

--- cH analysis ---
loss in acceptance?
fix simulation diagram
make all plots relevant to jet selection
make plot regarding diagram selection
introduce the data datasets that are used (maybe)
reducible background stuff
check wilks theorem stuff
theoretical uncertainties







Overall:

- Stuff on cH sample:
    -- Make diagram selection of cH 
    -- jet selection plots
    -- genParton diagram
    -- loss in acceptance from selection

--reducible backgrounds:
    -- use total yield with 3P1F shape? 

--unceratinties: 
    -- implement PDF and scale uncertainties
    -- check theory uncertainties
        --- 50% on ggH?
        --- other cross sections

--k-factors?

--do the fit..
