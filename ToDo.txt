--- cH analysis ---
fix simulation diagram
make all plots relevant to jet selection
reducible background stuff
theoretical uncertainties





Overall:

- Stuff on cH sample:
    -- Make diagram selection of cH DONE
    -- genParton diagram DONE
    -- jet selection plots DONE
    -- loss in acceptance from selection DONE

--reducible backgrounds:
    -- use total yield with 3P1F shape? 
    -- fake rate plot

--unceratinties: 
    -- implement PDF and scale uncertainties
    -- check theory uncertainties
        --- 50% on ggH?
        --- other cross sections

--k-factors?

--do the fit..

--introduce backgrounds DONE

--fix sample tables

--change binning of jet selection templates and rerun analysis





acceptance loss:
    -- 50% is inside detector acceptance (when not, its due to loss of at least one muon)
    -- after four muon selection approx 26% remains
    -- 11% remains after one jet requirement
    -- 10% remains after the Higgs reconstruction

    -- approx 70% of events have only one jet
    -- approx 25% have two jets
    -- 5% have more than two
